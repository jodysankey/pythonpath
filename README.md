# pythonpath

A collection of random things that form my pythonpath, mainly as a foundation on
which some of my [scripts](https://github.com/jodysankey/scripts.git) are built.

This repo is mainly for my personal use across the various machines I work with
but it's possible others will find one or two things in here that are useful.
I'm not putting much time into maintaining or evolving most of these, but if you
see anything thats obviously wrong or missing let me know.

Checkout with `git clone https://github.com/jodysankey/pythonpath.git`
